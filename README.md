# Skill-Test
CSCI 435 programming skill test. Searches through files in the current directory and sees if a matching xml and png set are there. If so creates a new edited png file with yellow boxes around leaf level GUI-components in an Android application screenshot. It then moves all edited pngs, if any, to a sub directory named Edited-Pngs
